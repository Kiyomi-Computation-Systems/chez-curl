# Progress ledger

Where chez-curl stands. Read it with [global-constraints.md](global-constraints.md)
before starting slice work. When a slice merges, update **Now** and add a
close-out under **Close-outs**, newest first.

## Now

- **Milestone:** M0 (brief §8), in progress.
- **Done:** slices 1 and 2 of the [harness plan](2026-10-04-harness-plan.md) (§6):
  - slice 1, the container and the Makefile skeleton;
  - slice 2, the test harness
    ([ADR-0015](decisions/0015-test-harness-and-scheme-dependencies.md)). Its close-out
    follows the merge.
- **Next slice:** slice 3, loading (ADR-0001, ADR-0002, ADR-0003):
  - `require-threaded`, the conditions, and pure discovery with its suite;
  - `native.sls`, with the load order, the version check and the probes;
  - `make build` as the preflight, the refusal probes, and `check-seam`.
- **Waiting on evidence:** ADR-0013 (`__collect_safe`) stays Proposed until spike E1
  at M3. Until then its rules bind as written.

## Close-outs

### 2026-10-04 — M0 slice 1: the pinned container and the Makefile skeleton (PR #4, `e8a2f63`)

- **Built ADR-0006's container, with Valgrind.** `scripts/guix-env` runs the pinned
  toolchain with no network. `make check-guix` tests the launcher on the host (60 checks),
  then checks the container from inside. A cached start takes about 1.5 s.
- **Checked the help.** `check-help` holds `make help`'s own listing equal to `.PHONY`,
  both ways.
- **Measured, and amended ADR-0006:**
  - the pinned toolchain has no `cc`, so the container exports `CC`;
  - `--emulate-fhs` does not let Guix's Chez load a library by bare name;
  - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` does, so the self-test asserts that such a load fails.
- **Evidence:** the [mutation log](guix-env-mutation-log.md) records 50 mutations, each
  failing its check by name. The red run caught a launcher test that passed for the wrong
  reason.
- **Carried forward:** `GOAL`'s `MAKECMDGOALS` branch stays unexercised until a target
  reaches `require-tools` through a prerequisite, which is slice 2's `test`.

### 2026-10-04 — living brief, harness plan, memory and test records (PR #3, `ea56eb4`)

- **The brief is a living document,** accepted for M0. It cites the records and defers to
  them where they disagree.
- **Recorded how M0 checks itself:**
  - ADR-0014: Valgrind on Linux is the memory gate, and it must be seen to fail.
  - ADR-0015: SRFI-64 comes from a vendored chez-srfi pinned in `Akku.lock`, and the suite
    rules are checks.
- **Planned the harness.** The harness plan covers what M0 copies from chez-cmark-gfm and
  chez-libuv, seven improvements on them, CI's lanes, and five slices.
- **Corrected two records:**
  - ADR-0006 gained Valgrind. It had been lost by copying cl-commonmark-gfm's container
    rather than chez-cmark-gfm's.
  - ADR-0013's E5 figures are chez-http-server's, measured on macOS only.
- **Renamed** `CHANGELOG.org` to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Carried forward:** close-outs written after a merge still land one PR late, as this
  one does.

### 2026-10-04 — ledger, constraints and the engine records (PR #2, `9077e28`)

- **Moved the ledger to `.plans/`.** AGENTS.md names this file as the ledger and
  `global-constraints.md` as the hard rules every task brief must follow. `/.superpowers/`
  is git-ignored plugin scratch.
- **Recorded the brief's engine rules.** ADR-0012 (accepted): one engine thread owns every
  transfer handle. ADR-0013 (proposed until spike E1): blocking calls are `__collect_safe`,
  and so is every callback they can invoke.
- **Carried forward:** close-outs written after a merge land one PR late, as this one did.

### 2026-10-04 — open decisions settled (PR #1, `407a8c5`)

- **Settled:** D1 to D11, as ADR-0001 to ADR-0011. That is the brief's D1 to D5, plus
  D6 to D11 raised while checking the brief against this host.
- **What changed the brief:**
  - Chez 10's `(__varargs_after n)` removed the C shim (ADR-0001).
  - Guix Chez cannot load the host's libcurl, so discovery reads which world it runs in
    (ADR-0002).
  - The floor moved to 7.85.0 for `CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR` (ADR-0003).
  - A container without `--network` keeps tests on loopback (ADR-0006).
- **Carried forward:** the probes run while deciding are M0's first tests in waiting:
  - varargs setopt;
  - the census of the options API;
  - world detection via `/proc/self/maps`;
  - `curl_url`'s verdicts;
  - the header-API probe;
  - the loopback-only container.

  They lived in session scratch and need writing as real tests.
